            <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
            <p class="last-updated">Effective Date: April 20, 2024</p>

            <p>Level Leap Studios ("we", "us", "our") is committed to maintaining user privacy through an ethical performance culture that is based on trust, simplicity and confidence. It is one of Level Leap Studios' core principles to secure user information while using our Mobile applications ("products"), and provide privacy protection that is critical in maintaining trust and providing better services. Level Leap Studios' individual privacy protection policy ensures the confidentiality of user information under the defined terms and conditions below.</p>

            <h3>1. Effective Date and Update</h3>
            <p>Effective date of this privacy policy: April 20, 2024<br>
            We may update this privacy statement to reflect changes to our information practices (See Section 12).</p>

            <h3>2. Information We Collect and Why</h3>
            <p>The use of our products and services may require user information input and consent for certain activities such as in-app purchases (if applicable), technical support, or participation in specific features.</p>
            
            <p>We collect information to provide and improve our products, offer support, process transactions, and personalize user experience. This information may include:</p>
            
            <h4>Information You Provide:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Contact Information (e.g., name, email address when contacting support or creating an optional account).</li>
                <li>Parent's email address, password, child's name/display name, age range, and parent's mobile number (Only if our product includes features specifically requiring parental involvement and account creation, subject to parental consent requirements like COPPA).</li>
                <li>Information provided during support requests (e.g., name, device information, description of the issue).</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Information Collected Automatically:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Device Information:</strong> Brand and model of your mobile device, operating system version, device identifiers (such as Advertising ID - IDFA for iOS, AAID for Android), language settings, IP address.</li>
                <li><strong>Usage Information:</strong> How you interact with our products (e.g., features used, levels played, session duration, achievements unlocked, in-app events). This is often collected via analytics tools.</li>
                <li><strong>Transaction Information:</strong> If you make in-app purchases, transaction details are processed by the relevant app store (Apple App Store, Google Play Store), and while we don't typically receive your full credit card number, we may receive transaction confirmation data.</li>
                <li><strong>Location Information:</strong> We may collect coarse location (e.g., country or region based on IP address) for analytics or content customization. If we need precise location data for a specific game feature (e.g., location-based gameplay), we will ask for your explicit permission first. You can typically disable location services at the device level or within the application's settings.</li>
                <li><strong>Internet Connection:</strong> Our products need to access the internet to connect to servers for core functionality, download updates, validate licenses (if applicable), and provide online features. (Data fees may be charged by your carrier).</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Specific Examples of Data Collection Scenarios:</h4>
            <p>2.1 When using product features requiring server interaction (e.g., leaderboards, cloud saves).<br>
            2.2 When requesting technical support.<br>
            2.3 When our products connect to servers for updates or core online functionality.<br>
            2.4 To provide analytics on product usage to understand user behavior and improve our products. We use device identifiers (like Advertising ID) and usage information for this purpose.<br>
            2.5 If a feature requires access to your contacts (e.g., to find friends who also use our products), we will request your explicit permission before accessing them.</p>

            <h4>Child Users:</h4>
            <p>2.6 We are mindful of collecting information from children. If a product is directed towards children under 13 (or applicable age), we limit personal information collection to persistent identifiers for internal operations (like analytics and ensuring functionality) unless we obtain verifiable parental consent.<br>
            2.7 A child's participation or access to an activity cannot be conditioned on him or her providing more Personal Information than is reasonably necessary for that activity.</p>

            <h3>3. How We Use Your Information</h3>
            <p>We use the information collected for the following purposes:</p>
            <p>3.1 To provide, maintain, and improve our products and services.<br>
            3.2 To personalize your experience within our products.<br>
            3.3 To provide customer support and respond to your inquiries.<br>
            3.4 To process transactions (facilitated through app stores).<br>
            3.5 To send you service-related communications, technical notices, updates, security alerts, and support messages (if you provide contact info like an email address).<br>
            3.6 To understand how users interact with our products through analytics, helping us improve user experience and product performance.<br>
            3.7 To provide relevant information, such as updates or promotional messages (where permitted by law and with your consent where required).<br>
            3.8 To enforce our terms of service and prevent potentially prohibited or illegal activities.<br>
            3.9 To comply with legal obligations.<br>
            3.10 To allow partners of Level Leap Studios (Service Providers) to use the information you provide to perform services on our behalf (e.g., analytics, ad serving, customer support). We require these partners to protect this information and use it only for the purposes we specify.</p>

            <h3>4. Sharing Your Information</h3>
            <p>We do not sell your personal information to third parties. We will not share your or your child's information with third parties other than as described in this policy:</p>
            
            <p>4.1 <strong>With Service Providers:</strong> We share information with third-party companies that perform services on our behalf, such as analytics providers, cloud storage providers, customer support services, and potentially ad networks (if our apps include ads). These companies are authorized to use your personal information only as necessary to provide these services to us and are obligated to protect your data. (See Section 15 for a list of key partners).</p>
            
            <p>4.2 <strong>With Your Consent:</strong> We may share information for other purposes with your explicit consent.</p>
            
            <p>4.3 <strong>For Legal Reasons:</strong> We may disclose information if required by law, subpoena, or other legal process, or if we have a good faith belief that disclosure is necessary to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>4.3.1 Protect our rights, property, or safety, or that of our users or the public.</li>
                <li>4.3.2 Investigate fraud or respond to a government request.</li>
                <li>4.3.3 Enforce our terms and conditions.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>4.4 <strong>Business Transfers:</strong> If Level Leap Studios is involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, your information may be transferred as part of that transaction. We will notify you via email (if we have it) and/or a prominent notice within our products of any change in ownership or uses of your personal information, as well as any choices you may have.</p>

            <h3>5. Security</h3>
            <p>Level Leap Studios takes reasonable measures to protect your personal information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. These measures include technical and organizational steps. We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us. However, no method of transmission over the Internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>

            <h3>6. International Data Transfers</h3>
            <p>As a global company, information we collect may be stored and processed in any country where we or our service providers operate. This means your information may be transferred to countries outside of your residence, which may have different data protection rules. We take appropriate safeguards to protect your information in accordance with this Privacy Policy and applicable law when transferring data internationally.</p>

            <h3>7. User IDs (UID)</h3>
            <p>When you use our products, our system may generate a unique user ID (UID) for you, which helps us identify users and provide services without necessarily relying on direct personal identifiers. We may associate usage data and device information with this UID.</p>

            <h3>8. Tracking Technologies (SDKs, Advertising IDs)</h3>
            <p>We and our third-party partners use various tracking technologies within our mobile applications:</p>
            
            <p>8.1 <strong>SDKs (Software Development Kits):</strong> Our partners (like analytics providers) provide SDKs that are integrated into our apps. These SDKs allow them (and us) to collect device and usage data for analytics, performance monitoring, and potentially ad serving.</p>
            
            <p>8.2 <strong>Advertising Identifiers:</strong> We may use your device's Advertising Identifier (IDFA on iOS, AAID on Android) for analytics and, if applicable, personalized advertising. You can typically reset your Advertising ID or limit ad tracking through your device's settings.</p>
            
            <p>8.3 <strong>Analytics Software:</strong> We use mobile analytics software (potentially from third parties listed in Section 15) to better understand the functionality and usage of our products. This software may record information such as app usage frequency, events within the app, aggregated usage, performance data, and download source. We generally do not link analytics data to personally identifiable information submitted elsewhere in the app, but anonymous or pseudonymized data is used.</p>
            
            <p>8.4 <strong>Pixels/Beacons:</strong> We may use tracking pixels in promotional emails (if you opt-in to receive them) to determine if emails have been opened and acted upon, helping us tailor future communications.</p>

            <h3>9. Social Media Features</h3>
            <p>Our products may include Social Media Features, such as "Share" buttons or links to social media platforms. These Features may collect your IP address and usage data within our app and may set cookies or use similar tracking technologies if you interact with them. These Features might be hosted by a third party or directly within our product. Your interactions with these Features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing them.</p>

            <h3>10. Third-Party Links and Services</h3>
            <p>Our products may contain links to third-party applications, services, or websites (e.g., through advertisements or partner integrations). We are not responsible for the privacy practices of these third parties. We recommend you review their privacy policies before interacting with them.</p>

            <h3>11. Disclaimers</h3>
            <p>11.1 We will disclose personal information if required by competent government authorities in accordance with legal procedures, laws, or regulations, or for public safety purposes, and assume no liability for such legally required disclosures.</p>
            
            <p>11.2 We are not responsible for disclosure resulting from your own actions (e.g., sharing your account credentials).</p>
            
            <p>11.3 We assume no responsibility for information loss or disclosure due to forces beyond our reasonable control (e.g., sophisticated hacker attacks, virus intrusions, temporary closures due to government action).</p>
            
            <p>11.4 We assume no responsibility for disclosures caused by third-party links, services, or code incorporated within our products, nor for legal disputes arising from them.</p>
            
            <p>11.5 We assume no responsibility when we or a third party uses your personal information in accordance with this policy or applicable laws.</p>
            
            <p>11.6 We assume no responsibility for disclosure due to unpredictable internet risks (e.g., virus attacks, hijacking) or unavoidable technical limitations.</p>

            <h3>12. Policy Modifications</h3>
            <p>We may update this privacy statement to reflect changes to our information practices. If we make any material changes, we will notify you by email (if we have your email address specified in an account) or by means of a prominent notice within our products prior to the change becoming effective. We encourage you to periodically review this policy for the latest information on our privacy practices.</p>
            
            <p>If we make material changes to how we collect, use, or disclose Personal Information collected from children under 13 (or applicable age), we will notify parents by email (if available) or other legally compliant method to obtain verifiable parental consent for the new uses or disclosures of the child's Personal Information, where required by law.</p>
